In this film it was very terrible and too graphic. I didn't see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what I read. We don't need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through. It's like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier. For example Mel Gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy. Letters of Iwo Jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history (although I could be wrong) except Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai. You're better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don't tell it right, and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill Japanese soldiers. Just read history on the internet, mags and in books. Movies always kill the sense of realization. What they did to POWs in Singapore and the Philippines was just dreadful escpically to civilians. It just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it.",

        "review": "Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever, free-spirited, and \"heavy on the bottle\" retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The pair embarks upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life. Challenging the domineering mother, as well as each other along the way, the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their lives.<br /><br />The comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the British veteran, Julie Walters. Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream. Directing comes naturally to Brock as he builds up stunning imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer down into an overabundance of adoration and creation. Even the subtle score by unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuate the tone and manner Brock had no trouble in generating.<br /><br />Laura Linney is always making her mark in films as she does as \"Laura.\" The bossy and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with Linney at the helm of it we are engulfed into that persona. The complexity of her character couldn't have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else. Rupert Grint breaks away from \"Ron Weasley\" and tries on someone new. His performance is more responsive than loquacious but Grint gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it. But the standout is coming from Oscar nominated actress Julie Walters who gives \"Evie\" a life of her own. Despite the role being clearly a leading one, Walters fairs better in the supporting category where I believe she can simply take home the prize. \"Evie\" is a mix of \"Clementine Kruczynski\" and \"Mrs. Laura Henderson\" with her free spirit and lovable persona. Hopefully her role will not go unnoticed this awards season.<br /><br />Driving Lessons isn't an \"out of this world\" experience but a fine, enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life, love, and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and sizes.<br /><br />Grade: ***/****",

The title on the box said \"Insect\" and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie. They can surely be fun, of course, as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make-up effects. Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in \"Blue Monkey\"! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense. Following the always-popular trend of \"big-bug\" movies, \"Blue Monkey\" handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. The makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! All we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. Other than this, there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! Like I said, don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. The first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) but the second half (when the entire hospital is put to quarantine) is dreadfully boring. It is also near the end that \"Blue Monkey\" begins to exaggeratedly rip-off older (and better) films. Approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore. \"Blue Monkey\" is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made. Fans of B-cinema may recognize John Vernon (\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\", \"Curtains\") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, who's in charge of the clinic.",

Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking.<br /><br />Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous. He would be content to sit back with his million$ and love her, she wishes to maintain her profession as a Doctor. She wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to amuse us. It cannot be salvaged by either the principals or the supporting cast.<br /><br />The faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDAs' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy.

Disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere. It is beautifully, if conventionally, animated; the highlight being the captivating scene where the Fairy Godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and Cinderella's rags to a gorgeous gown. Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston provide lovely songs like \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\" and \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\" that enhance both the scenario and the characters.<br /><br />Even though CINDERELLA's story is predictable, it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends. Both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat Lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of Cinderella and the mice. It is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers' interest. The film's suspense, however, is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness, especially in the musical numbers. It is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of Cinderella and her friends, moving the viewers to care for them. Overall, Walt Disney's CINDERELLA is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century.",

For me, at least, the payoff (after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you) was seeing the list of characters *after* the story was told. That's when the simple message hit home. But i wonder if Merhige could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30, instead of 78.<br /><br />However, seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie, the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early 20th century. Even then, you might puke.<br /><br />4/10 (but i commend Merhige for crafted a piece of art, even if it is unwatchable)",

One night while looking for his dog Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn, calling herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now. Obviously rather sceptical David has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse & calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to come examine her, however once he arrives & they enter the room Lucinda has disappeared. Charles puts it down to David drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to David & Mary...<br /><br />Witching Time was episode 1 from the short lived British anthology horror series produced by Hammer studios for TV & originally aired here in the UK during September 1980, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 The Mark of Satan being the other) I actually rather liked this. As a series Hammer House of Horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly Watching Time is a sinister & effective little tale about a witch, the script by Anthony Read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration & moves along at a nice pace. The character's are pretty good as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & I liked the way it never quite reveals whether David & Mary are going crazy or not. I think it's a well structured, entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Being made for British TV meant the boys at Hammer had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, & as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know Frankenstein & Dracula films although the contemporary English setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. Another TV based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for, there's some nudity & gore but not much although I didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good. It's well made for what it is & Hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good, the acting is good as well with genre favourite Ian McCulloch making a bit-part appearance.<br /><br />Witching Time is a good start to the Hammer House of Horror series, as a 50 minute piece of British TV it's pretty damned good, now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore?",

I thought there might be some campy fun in it, a \"so bad\" it becomes good vibe perhaps, I was wrong. I had watched it once long ago and didn't remember any of it. Now I know why. I was bored out of my mind and was looking for distractions to do something else. I'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor but Tank Girl does not work on any front. The script is bad, you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one-liners. The special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live-action. It's like they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so resorted to drawings, however cool they might be (an uncensored animated feature would be way better for Tank Girl now that I think about it). The action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b-movie way. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly decorated. As a matter of fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. <br /><br />It does have some interesting songs by known artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead but instead of improving the atmosphere, they just don't fit most of the time. Once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible. I think that's when I totally tuned out. I suppose Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks the trashy punkette part but beyond her \"attitude\" and sometimes barely amusing retorts, is more two-dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only saving grace of the film and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell wasn't too bad playing his usual villain role. It might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves (check out the entry for Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /><br />Rating: 3 out of 10",

Il a signé depuis \"Sans Sarah rien ne va\", les meilleures productions Apatow (surclassant même le patron). Crétinerie assumée, sens des situations absurdes (souvent hilarantes) et intelligence du propos, voilà les habituels ingrédients des films de ce jeune réalisateur qui décidément ne cesse de me surprendre.",

        "review": "Un très beau documentaire sur des gamins qui sont nés et qui grandissent dans le bordel de Calcutta, entourés de mères prostituées, de pères absents ou accros au hash, et qui n'ont pas droit à l'éducation. Et puis un jour, une photographe débarque dans leur ruelle sordide, et leur fait découvrir l'art de la photo, le plaisir du cadrage bien fait, des seconds plans, des couleurs ... Leurs photos feront le tour du monde ! Le plus incroyable dans ce film, c'est le déalage entre l'horreur quotidienne de ces gosses et leurs sourires, leur vivacité. Leur escapade au bord de la mer parait cruelle tant le retour dans les ruelles glauques du bordel semble injuste. Un grand bravo à Zana Briski pour son action auprès de ces enfants perdus, sans elle les filles auraient fini comme leur mère, sur le trottoir. Ils s'appellent Avijid, Shanti, Manik, Puja, Gaur, Sushitra, Kochi, Mamoni, Tapasi, et leur vie est bouleversante !",

La faute à un scénario tiré par les cheveux et aussi sans doute à un Gene Hackman peu crédible en président des U.S.A., qui ne semble pas vraiment lui-même y croire. Ça traine en longueur pour déboucher sur un final plutôt décevant.",

        "review": "L'histoire d'amour en Hollande entre Eric, un sculpteur bohème et sans lois et Olga, jeune femme qu'il rencontre en auto-stop et issue d'une famille conservatrice... La passion amoureuse et sexuelle, l'addiction à l'autre, l'amour destructeur ou encore la vie en couple, c'est une relation tumultueuse sous le signe de la libération et l'émancipation sexuelle que Paul Verhoeven met en scène pour son second film. Provocateur, cru, subversif et sans concessions, le hollandais violent met en avant cette belle mais chaotique histoire d'amour, teinté d'une certaine mélancolie. C'est à travers le portrait de ces deux jeunes hollandais que Verhoeven passionne et notamment Eric, qui voit en Olga la perfection, il en fait sa muse et lui donne tout son amour. Il décrit Eric comme un artiste anticonformiste, provocateur, charismatique et dont le sexe occupe une place très importante dans sa vie face à une Olga qui va découvrir le monde d'Eric et sortir de sa vie aisée et bourgeoise. Et Verhoeven retranscrit très bien toute cette passion, allant de beaux moments lyriques à l'amour destructeur en passant par la consommation de cet amour. \"Turkish Delight\" représente aussi le tableau d'une société hollandaise qui évolue, où la vie bohème et la libération sexuelle représentée par Eric sont opposé à la vie bourgeoise et traditionnel de la famille d'Olga et notamment de sa mère. Très bien écrit et sans oublier l'humour, \"Turkish Delight\" bascule peu à peu vers le drame où l'amour fou ne survit pas à la vie de couple et au temps qui passe. Verhoeven nous offre un cocktail d'émotion avant de voir, avec mélancolie, les changements de la vie et du temps. Et enfin \"Turkish Delight\" repose aussi sur son talentueux duo de comédiens et notamment Rutger Hauer où son charisme crève déjà l'écran. Dès ce second film Verhoeven pose les bases de son cinéma et livre une histoire d'amour non conventionnelle sur fond de libération sexuelle dans une société hollandaise en évolution.",

Un film qui se croit drôle, trop prétentieux, et qui remet sur le tapis une série de gags de situations vus et revus. La prestation des acteurs est sérieusement à désirer, Emmanuel Mouret devrait faire un choix entre la réalisation et le jeu d'acteur (ou bien arrêter les deux?), car en plus il occupe le rôle principal (c'est pas prétentieux?), et il l'interprète très très mal: il a aucun oeil et joue vraiment faux! Quant à Judith Godrèche et ses sourires niais, c'est même pas la peine d'en parler... Déborah François est pas mauvaise (mais a un rôle moindre) tout comme Frédérique Bel. Mais bon, çà sauve en rien le film qui est des plus nuls que j'ai vu dans le registre \"comique\".",

        "review": "Le Château de l’araignée prouve deux choses : Le talent exceptionnel du réalisateur Akira Kurosawa et l’universalité de l’œuvre de William Shakespeare. Macbeth s’active dans le Japon féodal comme s’il y était né. Le personnage de Lady Macbeth prend encore plus de dimension dans le souffle du théâtre nô comme si cela venait mettre en exergue sa relation avec le diable. Les deux comédiens qui incarnent le couple maudit permettent à la production d’atteindre le niveau tragique que commande originalement la pièce. Elle tout en retenue et en profondeur, lui d’une intensité démesurée. Même s’il nous est plus difficile de juger la justesse de leur interprétation, la frénésie soutenue dans leur jeu, les décors épurés et la prise de vue géométrique propre au cinéma japonais viennent souligner l’aspect rituel de leurs actions et le caractère fabuleux de l’histoire. La photographie est magnifique et puissante. Le brouillard naturel qui sévissait pendant les extérieurs, et qui rendait la tâche particulièrement difficile à l’équipe de tournage, crée au final un climat empreint de mystère très approprié. Les séquences équestres, l’ambiance sonore, les scènes à grand déploiement tout en sobriété, il n’y a rien qui fait défaut. Il se dégage beaucoup de poésie de la violence souterraine que recèle l’univers shakespearien et l’œuvre de Kurosawa l’exprime de manière sublime. Au milieu XVIe siècle on hésitait entre croire aux prophéties ou forcer le destin. Cinq cents ans plus tard, on remercie le ciel pour la rencontre Shakespeare-Kurosawa.",
